## Contributing

Check the opened issues in order to see how you can contribute.

When contributing, make sure to base your branch off of the `development` branch and create your Pull Request into that same branch.
Pull Requests into the `main` branch will be rejected.

Make also sure to check the opened pull requests before creating yours, as it is possible that the changes you want to make might already be under development.

## Making Changes

> **Note:** It is required to create a new branch for each Pull Request (based on the current `development` branch).

Depending on your changes there are certain rules you have to follow in order for your Pull Request to be merged:

1. Development

   - Keep your code consistent
     - Make sure your code follows the project [Coding Style]()
     - Make sure there are no code duplication
   - Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies
   - Self-review your code regularly
     - Test your code (make sure it works)
     - Create tests for library-like methods
   - Comment your code a minimum
     - Comment hard-to-understand parts of your code
     - Javadoc is mandatory for library-like methods
   - Verify that your contribution does not embark proprietary code or infringe any copyright of any sort

2. Commiting

   - Commit as you code
     - *Optional:* Try to make one commit per feature addition/modification/deletion
     - Making multiple commits can help the reader understand your changes
     - Still it might sometimes be better to include more changes in a single commit
   - Write a proper commit message explaining what you have done

3. Pushing your Commits 

   - Push your commits
   - Open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
     - Make sure to base your Pull Request into `development`
   - Fill the Pull Request template
   - Create the Pull Request
